How might using version control make you more 
confident to make changes that could break 
something?

Foreknowledge that you can undo your errors 
may lead to more confidence.



Now that you have your workspace set up, what
do you want to use Git for?

So far, I know how to use Git to start Sublime, 
access and compare versions of file commits, 
navigate Windows file system and move files.  I 
want to learn what else can be done in Git.

Describe the process for using Git to clone a 
repository and locate a bug.

Clone the repository:
(In Git Bash:  git clone ...URL.git...)
Locate the repository in Windows Explorer. (Unhide
files, look in C:/user/9wyrd/AppData/Local/Programs/).
Open index.html in Firefox to view file.  In gitbash, 
change to the repository directory (using the path above)
and run git log.  q out of git log and git checkout commits 
by ID, refreshing the browser window on the index.htm 
until the version with the bug is located.  git diff
the version before and after the intro of the bug to 
pinpoint the code that intro'd the bug.
