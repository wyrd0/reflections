When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository is helpful when you use multiple clients to push changes or when multiple people are working on the same project/repo.




Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If two users are simultaneously making changes to the same section of code, having updates pushed to each of them from the remote repo in real time could be overwhelming for the users.  In the case of using local repositories on more than one client computer, github would have to constantly push data to many systems, worldwide, unnecessarily tying up resources.  The operation would quickly become prohibitively resource hoggy.




Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a copy of a repository on github that carries metadata to refer to the original.  A clone is a copy of a repository.  Branches are a series of commits, within a repository, that have a history /ancestry that is independent of that of other branches.
Branches can be used in conjunction with either forks or clones.  They are not analogous concepts.  Forks should be used when you want to clone the repo belonging to another user who has not given you permission to make changes to the original.  Clones can be used to copy an entire repository when you intend to commit changes back to the origin.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Git uses this to report the state of your local repo, compared to remote.
